# @qgustavor/later


This project is a ES Modules fork of Later. Later is a library for describing recurring schedules and calculating their future occurrences.  It supports a very flexible schedule definition including support for composite schedules and schedule exceptions. Create new schedules manually, via Cron expression, via natural language expressions, or using a fully chainable API.

This fork also removed benchmarks, tests and all the other fuss I don't plan to maintain.
